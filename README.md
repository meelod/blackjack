# Blackjack
 
In this program, the goal is to achieve a deck count as close to 21 as possible without going going over 21. The player can choose to draw a random number between 1 and 11, or choose to pass to the AI algorithm. The goal of the AI algorithm is to get a higher deck count than the player.  
Example:
-- If a player has a desk count of 20, the AI algorithm will choose to draw.  

Whoever has the highest deck count without going over 21 wins the game.
